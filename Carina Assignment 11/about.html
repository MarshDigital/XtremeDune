                <h2> Get to know your Guide </h2>
                <p>Raking in over 35 years of experience in extreme sport, and a well-known speed freak and adrenalin
                    junkie
                    in his own right, your tour guide and owner of Xtreme Dune Adventures, Jade will ensure that you
                    have an
                    experience of a lifetime. There are no specific fitness levels to take part in quad biking or beach
                    buggy
                    riding on the dunes and if you are too young to have a drivers license your qualified tour guide
                    will
                    take
                    you on a ride of your life! . <br> <br>

                    With the breath-taking views of Table Mountain in the background, you will experience the amazing
                    surroundings of the beautiful dunes along the way (if you have time to smell the roses)
                    but donâ€™t worry, your guide is very happy to stop for pics and selfies. <br> <br>

                    It is important to note that this adventure is not for anyone under the age of 16 or pregnant woman.
                    Even though your tour guide is First Aid registered, you will need to inform your tour guide of any
                    health-related issues beforehand.
