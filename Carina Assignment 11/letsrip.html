            <h2> Full Description </h2>
            <p>Revel in soft sand dunes on the back of a quad bike or pipe car also known as a sidewinder on this
                outdoor adventure in
                the Atlantis Dunes just north of Cape Town. <br> <br>

                Just a short drive up the picturesque West Coast of South Africa you'll find the Atlantic Dunes in
                Dassenberg, Atlantis.
                An important conservation area protecting the Atlantis Aquifer and native wildlife, the reserve is also
                home to some of
                the best spots for quad biking with dunes up to 50 meters high. <br> <br>

                Check-in at the Parks office once you arrive and meet your instructor and guide, who will assist you
                with obtaining your
                parks permit (to be paid in cash). Once the paperwork has been handled, your instructor will take you
                through an
                introduction to quad biking and a thorough safety briefing. <br> <br>

                Now that you're comfortable with the quad bike, follow your guide out into the dunes to enjoy an
                hour-long,
                adrenaline-pumping ride in the soft sands. Explore the dunes and marvel at the surrounding landscape,
                including views of
                Table Mountain as you complete your adventure.
